		<br>
		The first 6 months of our friendship together: <br>
		When we met (technically that was at Rise-Up, but when we <em><strong>really</strong></em> met ðŸ™„),
		I don't think either of us expected to be where we are today. We were such an unlikely pair to become so close, 
		with you being scared to open up and show emotions even to your best friends, and me not even being confident that I 
		myself am a good person, and yet we ended up connecting somehow. 
		I don't know why you did, but of all people, you trusted and accepted <strong>me</strong>>. If not for that it 
		wouldn't have mattered what I did. I know, because I still can't get you to do some things I want ðŸ˜‚.
		But that just shows that you became friends with me because you actually wanted to. <strong><em>You</em></strong>
		wanted to. You didn't need to do that. Sometimes I wasn't confident that I could be the best friend I wanted to be with
		you, and sure, I probably wasn't going to leave, but it didn't even matter because you didn't let me leave. 
		You <strong>didn't <em>need</em></strong> to be my friend, but <em><strong>YOU</strong></em> made our friendship happen.
		And for that, I'll never be able to convey how grateful I am. Like, seriously. I may not have been the best friend to you.
		Sometimes I would talk about sensitive topics and not realize it was making you cry. I ask so much of you and make you
		talk to me more than others that you care even more for because I need so much attention. I've also learned so much from
		you and grown through these 6 months with you. And I might have been uncertain about being friends anymore, but now I 
		don't look back. It's too late to leave â€” we're besties and that's a fact!
		<br>
		<br>
		I wish I'd come up with this idea before. I would have recorded dates like the day we became each other's #1 BFF on 
		snapchat
